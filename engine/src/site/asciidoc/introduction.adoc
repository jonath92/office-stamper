= Introduction to OfficeStamper

OfficeStamper (formerly Docx-Stamper) is a Java template engine that allows for dynamic creation of DOCX documents at runtime.
You design a template using your preferred Word processor; and OfficeStamper will generate documents based on that template.

== What is OfficeStamper?

OfficeStamper is a library that enables you to:

* Create dynamic DOCX documents from templates
* Replace placeholders with actual data
* Conditionally show or hide content
* Repeat sections based on collections of data
* Maintain the original formatting of your templates

== Key Features

* **Expression-based templating**: Use Spring Expression Language (SpEL) for powerful template expressions
* **Comment-based processing**: Add special instructions as comments in your Word documents
* **Formatting preservation**: All formatting from the original template is preserved
* **Custom functions**: Extend the templating capabilities with your own functions
* **Type-safe**: Strong typing for Java integration
* **Flexible configuration**: Customize the behavior to suit your needs
