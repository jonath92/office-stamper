= Comment Processors

Alongside expression replacement, Office-stamper presents the feature of *processing comments* associated with paragraphs in your .docx template.
These comments act as directives for manipulating the template.

== How Comment Processors Work

1. You add a comment to a paragraph, table row, or other element in your Word document.
2. In the comment, you write a special expression that tells Office-stamper what to do with that element.
3. When Office-stamper processes the document, it finds these comments and applies the specified operations.
4. After processing, the comments are removed from the final document

== Default Comment Processors

Office-stamper comes with several built-in comment processors that handle common templating needs:

[cols=">1,4"]
|===
| Expression in .docx comment           | Effect on the commented paragraph/paragraphs
| `displayParagraphIf(boolean)`         | It is only displayed if condition resolves to `true`.
| `displayTableRowIf(boolean)`          | The table row around it is only displayed if condition resolves to `true`.
| `displayTableIf(boolean)`             | The surrounding table is only displayed if condition resolves to `true`.
| `repeatParagraph(List<Object>)`       | It is copied once for each object in the passed-in list. Expressions found in the copies are evaluated against the object from the list.
| `repeatTableRow(List<Object>)`        | The surrounding table row is copied once for each object in the passed-in list. Expressions found in the cells of the table row are evaluated against the object from the list.
| `repeatDocPart(List<Object>)`         | The commented text is copied once for each object in the passed-in list. Expressions found in the copies are evaluated against the object from the list. Can be used instead of repeatTableRow and repeatParagraph if you want to repeat more than table rows and paragraphs.
| `replaceWordWith(expression)`         | Replace the commented word with the value of the given expression. (obsolete, use replaceWith instead)
| `replaceWith(expression)`         | Replace the commented word with the value of the given expression. (the selection cannot run over several paragraph)
| `resolveTable(StampTable)`            | Replace a table (that must have one column and two rows) with the values given by the StampTable. The StampTable contains a list of headers for columns, and a 2-level list of rows containing values for each column.

=== Conditional Display

The `displayXXXIf` family of processors allows you to conditionally show or hide content based on a boolean expression:

[source]
----
displayParagraphIf(customer.vip)
displayTableRowIf(order.items.size() > 0)
displayTableIf(report.hasData())
----

There are also convenience methods for checking if objects are present or absent:

[source]
----
displayParagraphIfPresent(customer.address)
displayTableRowIfAbsent(order.discounts)
----

=== Repetition

The `repeatXXX` family of processors allows you to repeat content for each item in a collection:

[source]
----
repeatParagraph(order.items)
repeatTableRow(employees)
repeatDocPart(chapters)
----

When using these processors, expressions within the repeated content are evaluated against each item in the collection.

=== Word Replacement

The `replaceWith` processor allows you to replace a specific word with the result of an expression:

[source]
----
replaceWith(customer.name)
----

=== Table Resolution

The `resolveTable` processor allows you to dynamically generate a table from data:

[source]
----
resolveTable(report.dataTable)
----

== Headers and Footers

The .docx file format doesn't permit comments within headers or footers.
But there's a workaround in Office-stamper.
If you want to display contents within headers or footers conditionally, or require repetitive elements:

1. Craft the expression as you would in a comment.
2. Encapsulate it with "#{}".
3. Position it at the starting of the paragraph you intend to manipulate.

Example:
[source]
----
#{displayParagraphIf(showPageNumbers)} Page ${pageNumber} of ${totalPages}
----

== Error Handling

By default, an exception is thrown if a comment fails to process. However, successfully processed comments are wiped from the document.

You can customize the error handling behavior. See the link:troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting] section for more details.

== Custom Comment Processors

You can create your own comment processors to handle specific templating needs. See the link:custom-settings.html[Custom Settings] section for more information.
