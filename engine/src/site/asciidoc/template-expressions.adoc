= Template Expressions

The foundation of OfficeStamper lies in its ability to *replace expressions* within the text of a .docx template document.

== Basic Expression Syntax

OfficeStamper uses the Spring Expression Language (SpEL) for its template expressions. Expressions are enclosed in `${...}` delimiters.

Examples:
[source]
----
${person.name}
${order.total * 0.2}
${person.age > 18 ? 'Adult' : 'Minor'}
----

== Expression Evaluation

When OfficeStamper processes a template, it evaluates each expression against the context object you provide. The result of the evaluation replaces the expression in the output document.

=== Context Object

The context object is a Java object that contains the data you want to insert into your document. It can be:

* A POJO (Plain Old Java Object) with getters
* A Map with string keys
* Any object that can be accessed using SpEL

=== Formatting Preservation

OfficeStamper maintains the original text's formatting in the template. This means that if your expression is bold, italic, or has any other formatting, the replacement text will have the same formatting.

== Spring Expression Language Features

OfficeStamper gives you full access to the extensive feature set of link:http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/expressions.html[Spring Expression Language (SpEL)].

Some useful SpEL features include:

* **Property access**: `${person.address.city}`
* **Method invocation**: `${person.getFullName()}`
* **Array/List access**: `${orders[0].id}`
* **Map access**: `${data['key']}`
* **Operators**: `${price * quantity}`
* **Conditionals**: `${person.age > 18 ? 'Adult' : 'Minor'}`
* **Regular expressions**: `${name matches '[A-Z][a-z]+'}`
* **Collection projection**: `${orders.![total]}`
* **Collection selection**: `${orders.?[total > 100]}`

== Resolvers

OfficeStamper uses a chain of resolvers to convert the result of an expression evaluation into a string that can be inserted into the document. The resolvers are applied in a specific order.

[cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
| Default Resolvers         | When the placeholder resolves to a | It will be replaced in the document with
| `Resolvers.image()`       | `pro.verron.officestamper.preset.Image` | an inline image
| `Resolvers.legacyDate()`  | `java.util.Date`                   | a formatted Date string (default "dd.MM.yyyy")
| `Resolvers.isoDate()`     | `java.time.LocalDate`              | a formatted Date string (default DateTimeFormatter.ISO_LOCAL_DATE)
| `Resolvers.isoTime()`     | `java.time.LocalTime`              | a formatted Date string (default DateTimeFormatter.ISO_LOCAL_TIME)
| `Resolvers.isoDateTime()` | `java.time.LocalDateTime`          | a formatted Date string (default DateTimeFormatter.ISO_LOCAL_DATE_TIME)
| `Resolvers.nullToEmpty()` | `null`                             | an empty string
| `Resolvers.fallback()`    | `Object`                           | the result of the call to `String.valueOf()` method on the object
|===

If a placeholder fails to resolve successfully, OfficeStamper will skip it, and the placeholder in the document remains the same as its initial state in the template.

== Custom Resolvers

You can create your own resolvers to handle specific types or formatting requirements. See the link:custom-settings.html[Custom Settings] section for more information.

== Error Handling

By default, if an expression cannot be evaluated (due to syntax errors, missing properties, etc.), OfficeStamper will throw an exception. You can customize this behavior using exception resolvers. See the link:troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting] section for more details.
