== {proj}/releases/tag/v2.7.0[v2.7.0]

=== Features

* Add the `PostProcessor` concept to be able to add cleaners or summaries at stamping finish.
* #68 Filled to `displayXXXIf` panoply with:
** `displayParagraphIf(boolean)`, `displayParagraphIfPresent(object)` and `displayParagraphIfAbsent(object)`
** `displayTableRowIf(boolean)`, `displayTableRowIfPresent(object)` and `displayTableRowIfAbsent(object)`
** `displayTableIf(boolean)`, `displayTableIfPresent(object)` and `displayTableIfAbsent(object)`
** `displayWordsIf(boolean)`, `displayWordsIfPresent(object)` and `displayWordsIfAbsent(object)`
** `displayDocPartIf(boolean)`, `displayDocPartIfPresent(object)` and `displayDocPartIfAbsent(object)`
* The two provided evaluation context configurer now include the classic Get Accessor and the Map Accessor, so the object used as context can be much more flexible.
** ie. `$+{name}+` can now refer to an object `getName()` method or to a map `get("name")` value.

=== Bugfixes

* BREAKING - `Paragraph#getComment` now returns a Collection instead of an Optional, because one paragraph can have several comments.
Fixes a bug when commenting several groups of runs by different comments in a single paragraph.
* #69 Office-stamper is now aware of Footnotes and Endnotes, it only cleans orphaned notes with `standardWithPreprocessing` configuration for now, but probably going to run the stamping as well in future versions.
* #510 All `repeatXXX` can now accept Iterable as input
